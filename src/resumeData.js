  aboutme:
    "I'm Dakota, but I go by Kotie and I've recently become interested in coding and developing which led me start an 8 month intensive bootcamp while still supporting my wife and fur-kids. I was born and raised in Utah and met my beautiful wife going on five years ago and have never looked back. We have two dogs who keep us plenty busy and who we absolutely adore. I'm grateful to be able to pursue my dreams and have the great support system from my family and friends. The journey seemed long with having school during the day and work at night as well as barely spending time with my family, but it was well worth it. I'm so excited to finally be ready to be doing what I learned and studied and to learn even more in the process. I'm bright and eager to grow with whatever life throws my way. Here's to becoming the very best that I can be, not only for myself, but for the people I love. ",
